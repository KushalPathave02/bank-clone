## ðŸš€ How to Run the Application

### 1. Install Dependencies

If you haven't already, open your terminal in the project root and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Expo Development Server

To start the app, run one of the following commands:

```bash
# To run on your local network (recommended for mobile)
npx expo start --lan

# To run in a web browser
npx expo start --web
```

After running the command, you will see a QR code in your terminal.

### 3. Open on Your Mobile Device

- **Install the Expo Go app** on your iOS or Android device.
- **Ensure your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.**
- Scan the QR code from the terminal using the Expo Go app (or your phone's camera app).

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting: "Network Response Timed Out"

This is a common error and is almost always a local network issue. Hereâ€™s how to fix it:

1.  **Same Wi-Fi Network**: Double-check that your computer and phone are on the exact same Wi-Fi network. Avoid guest networks.

2.  **Firewall**: Your computer's firewall might be blocking the connection. 
    -   **Windows**: You may get a pop-up asking for permission for "Node.js" to access the network. Make sure you **allow access** on both Private and Public networks.
    -   **macOS**: Check your firewall settings in System Preferences > Security & Privacy.

3.  **Use LAN Mode**: Always start the server with the `--lan` flag. This is more reliable than the default "Local" mode for connecting from another device.
    ```bash
    npx expo start --lan
    ```

4.  **Clear Cache**: Sometimes the bundler cache causes issues. Stop the server and restart it with the `-c` flag.
    ```bash
    npx expo start -c --lan
    ```

5.  **Try Tunnel Mode (If LAN Fails)**: If your network is restrictive, tunnel mode can work as a last resort. It can be slower.
    ```bash
    npx expo start --tunnel
    ```
